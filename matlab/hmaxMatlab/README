HMAX: Hierarchical Model And X
==============================

HMAX is a hierarchical, shape-based, computational model of visual object recognition in cortex. It summarizes the basic facts of the ventral visual stream, thought to mediate object recognition in cortex.

Files
-----

Included are the following files and directories:

- AUTHORS: a list of the project's authors and maintainers.

- LICENSE: the project's license.

- README: this document.

- C1.m: Given an image, this function returns S1 & C1 unit responses.

- C2.m: Given an image, this function returns S1, C1, S2, & C2 unit responses.

- example.m: an example code implementing the full HMAX hierarchy, using the provided universal patch set and the provided example image set. This function will call all the relevant subfunctions of the HMAX-MATLAB implementation.

- initGabor.m: Given orientations and receptive field sizes, this function returns a set of Gabor filters.

- maxFilter.m: Given an image and pooling range, this function returns a matrix of the image's maximum values in each neighborhood defined by the pooling range

- padImage.m: Given an image, padding amount, and padding method, this function returns a padded image. Think of it as padarray operating on only the first 2 dimensions of a 3 dimensional array.

- extractC2forCell.m: Extract all responses for a set of images.

- sumFilter.m: Given an image and pooling range, this function returns an image where each "pixel" represents the sums of the pixel values within the pooling range of the original pixel.

- unpadImage.m: undoes padimage - given an image and padding amount, this function strips padding off an image

- windowedPatchDistance.m: given an image and patch, this function computes the euclidean distance between the patch and all crops of the image of similar size.

- universal_patch_set.mat: a file containing a set of universal patches of 8 different sizes extracted from random natural images. The file also includes the parameters used during the patch-extraction.

- exampleImages directory - a folder containing 10 images from the Labeled Faces in the Wild database (http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/).

- exampleImages.mat: a cell array, each cell contains the path to one image located in the exampleImages folder.

- exampleActivations.mat: a file containing c2, bestBands, and bestLocations variables (see C2.m). This is the output of the example.m code.
